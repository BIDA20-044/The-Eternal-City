<p> 
<i>The city of Rome was founded in 753BC .Rome is known for its beautiful tourist attractions and 
historical sites, whcih go way back in the 700's BC's.Rome is a city located in Italy . Rome is a 
city and a special commune named Roma Captile in Italy. Rome is the capital city of Italy and also
the province of Rome and of the region of Lazio. Since the ancient times, to be a citizen of Rome has been  
a source of pride. Today there is still cosiderable prestige in being a Romano di Roma, or"Roman Roman". 
Rome is where the Ancient Romans craeted systems and srtuctures that we stll use to this day. "The Eternal City"
is one of the most popular nicknames for Rome for excellent reasons.</i>

<p><i>Once the capital of ancient republic an empire whose armies polity defined the Western world in antiquity
and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter,the spiritual and physicalseat of the Roman Catholic Church,
 and the site of the major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievemnt, Rome is an eternal ctiy, remaining today
a political capital, a religious center, and amemorial to the creative imaginamtion if the past. For well over
a millennium, Rome controlled the destiny of all civilization known to Europe, but then it fell into dissolution 
and disrepair.Physically mutilated , economically paralyzed,politically senile, and military impotenet by the located .
Middle Ages. Rome never the less remained a world power- as an idea. The force of Rome the law giver , teacher ,a nd 
 builder continued to radiate throughout  Europe. Although the situation of the popes from the 6th and 15th centuray
 was often precarious, Rome knew glory as te fountain head of Christianity and eventually won back its power and wealth
 and reestablished itself as a place of beauty, a source of learning and a capital of the arts.</i>

<img src="colosseum.png" alt="colosseum"/>

<p><i>Located just east of the Roma Forum, the massive stone amphitheatre known as the Colosseum was commssioned 
around A.D. 70-72 by Emparior Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, Vespasian's
son Titus opend the Colosseum - officially known as the Flavian Amphitheater- with 100 days of games , including 
gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights . After four centuries of active use , the maginficent arena fell into 
neglect, and until the 18th century it was used as a source of building materials. Though two thirds of the the original
Colosseum has been destroyed over time , the amphitheater- reamins a popular tourist destiantion, as well as an 
iconic symbol of Rome and its long tumultuous history.</i>

<p><i>The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian and was finished 
  in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, the Colosseum became the greatest 
  Roman amphitheatre, measuring 188 meters in length, 156 meters in width and 57 meters in height.</i></p>

   Here are some of the best tourist attractions and Hotels to visit on your holiday there!!
</p>
<h2>1.The Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine</h2>
<img src="tourist attraction 2 (2).png" alt="tourist site"/>

<p>As the Eiffel Tower is to paris, the silhouette of the Alphhitheater is to Rome .The largest structure left to us by the 
Roman antiquity, the Colosseum still provides the model for sports arenas- present day football stadium design 
is clearly based on the oval roman plan. The Colosseum was large enough for theoratical perfromances, festivals, circuses
, or games, which the Imperial court and high officials watched from the lowest level, arstocratic Roman families 
on the second , the populance on the third and forth.

<p>Beside the Colosseum stands the alsomt equally familiar Arch of Constatine,a trimphal arch erected by the Senate
to honor the emperor as "libartorof the city and bringer of peace." after his victory in the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. 
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">     2.Vatican City</h2>
<img src="tourist attraction 2 (3).png"/>

<p> Vatcan city is the smallest and independent state in the world, with an area of less than half a squre kilometer
, most of it enclosed the Vatican walls . Inside are the Vitaican palace and gardens <b>St Peter's Basilica</b> and
<b>St Peter's Square</b>, an area ruled by the pope, supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church. This comapct
space offers a lot of the things to see, between its museums and the great basillica itself
</p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"  >    3.The Pantheon</h2>
<img src="tourist attraction 2 (4).png" alt="Pantheon"

<p>The Pantheon - the best-preserved monument of Roman antiquity - is remarkably intact for its 2000 years. 
  This is despite the fact that Pope Gregory III removed the gilded bronze roof tiles, and Pope Urban VIII 
  ordered its bronze roof stripped and melted down to cast the canopy over the altar in St. Peter's and 
  cannons for Castel Sant'Angelo.
The Pantheon was rebuilt after damage by fire in AD 80, and the resulting brickwork shows the 
extraordinarily high technical mastery of Roman builders. Its 43-meter dome, the supreme achievement 
of Roman interior architecture, hangs suspended without visible supports - these are well hidden inside 
the walls - and its nine-meter central opening is the building's only light source.
  The harmonious effect of the interior is a result of its proportions: the height is the same as the 
  diameter. Although the first Christian emperors forbade using this pagan temple for worship, in 609 
  Pope Boniface IV dedicated it to the Virgin and all the Christian martyrs, and since then, it has 
  become the burial place of Italian kings (Victor Emmanuel II is in the second niche on the right) 
  and other famous Italians, including the painter Raphael.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> 4.Roman Forum</h4>
<img src="tourist attraction 2 (1).png" alt="Roman Forum"/>

<p>Walking through the forum, now in the middle of a throbbing modern city, is like stepping back two 
  millennia into the heart of ancient Rome. Although what survives of this center of Roman life and 
  government shows only a small fraction of its original splendor, the standing and fallen columns, 
  its triumphal arches, and remains of its walls still impress, especially when you consider that for
   centuries, the history of the Forum was the history of the Roman Empire and of the Western world.
Roman political and religious life was centered here, along with the courts, markets, and meeting places. 
After the seventh century, the buildings fell into ruin, and churches and fortresses were built amid the 
ancient remains. Its stones were quarried for other buildings and it was not until the 18th and 19th 
centuries that systematic excavations brought the ancient buildings to light from under a 10-meter layer of 
earth and rubble.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">       5.  Trevi Fountain</h2>
<img src="Trevi Fountain.jpg" alt="trevi fountaion">
<p>One of the city's most popular tourist attractions, this 17th-century masterpiece has been immortalized 
  in films until it is almost a required visit. Throwing a coin (not three) into the Trevi Fountain (
    Fontana di Trevi) is a tradition that is supposed to assure your return to Rome.
Rome's largest fountain, Fontana di Trevi is supplied by an aqueduct originally constructed by Agrippa, 
the great art patron of the first century BC, to bring water to his baths. The fountain was created for 
Pope Clement XII between 1732 and 1751 by Nicolò Salvi, and built against the rear wall of the palace of 
the Dukes of Poli.
  It depicts the sea god Oceanus (Neptune), with horses, tritons, and shells. The water swirls around the 
  figures and the artificial rocks, and collects in a large basin, always filled with coins.
