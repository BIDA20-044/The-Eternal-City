<p><i>Italian cuisine has influenced food culture around the world and is viewed as a form of art by many.<br> 
    Wine, cheese and pasta are important part of Italian meals.In the North of Italy, fish, potatoes, 
    <br> rice, sausages, pork and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><i>THE HISTORY OF FOOD IN ROME</i></h2>

<p>
    Roman cuisine comes from the Italian city of Rome. It features fresh, seasonal and simply-prepared<br>
    ingredients from Roman Campagna.These include peas, globe artichokes and fava beans, shellfish,<br> 
    milk-fed lamb and goat, and cheeses such as Pecorino Romano and ricotta.Olive oil is used mostly,<br>
    to dress raw vegetables, while strutto (pork lard) and fat from prosciutto are preferred for frying.<br>
    The most popular sweets in Rome are small individual pastries called pasticcini, gelato (ice cream) and<br>
    handmade chocolates and candies. Special dishes are often reserved for different days of the week; for<br> 
    example, gnocchi is eaten on Thursdays, baccalà (salted cod) on Fridays, and trippa on Saturdays.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Rome's food has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes.
     <br>Rome became a major gastronomical center during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly 
     influenced by <br>Ancient Greek culture. Subsequently, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans 
     to many new, provincial <br>culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning, the differences 
     between social<br> classes were not very great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth. Later, 
     during the Italian Renaissance,<br> Rome became well known as a center of high-cuisine, since some of the
      best chefs of the time worked for the popes.<br> An example of this could be Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a 
      chef working for Pius IV in the Vatican kitchen, reaching fame with<br> his cookbook Opera dell'arte del 
      cucinare, published in 1570.<br> Here he lists approximately 1000 recipes of Renaissance cuisine and 
      describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first<br> known picture of a fork.Roman and all
       Italian cuisine were transformationally influenced by the introduction of new world crops by the 
       Spanish,<br> especially the tomato.

<h2>Pasta in Rome</h2>
<br>
<img height="700"   width="1000"src="food 3.png" alt="pasta">
<br>Pasta is one important element of Roman cuisine. Famous Roman pasta dishes include cacio e pepe,<br>(cheese and black pepper), gricia (a sauce made with pancetta or guanciale and hard cheese, typically <br>Pecorino Romano), carbonara (like gricia but with the addition of egg), and <br>amatriciana (like gricia but with the addition of tomato and possibly onion).<br> Alfredo (invented in Rome by the chef of restaurant "Alfredo alla Scrofa") is famous abroad,<br> but not considered traditional and mostly unheard of in Rome.
There used to be a pasta museum in Rome called the Museo Nazionale della Paste Alimentari <br>(the National Museum of Pasta),but now there is a hotel there. Rome's most common pasta shape<br> is spaghetti, but there are many other forms.
